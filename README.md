**Single file** RAG (ChromaDB) with hybrid search, smart chunking, and normalized scoring. Enterprise-grade quality with comprehensive testing and security enhancements. 

## Quick Start

Download `raggy.py` and place it in the root of your project. All you need to do next is put all your documents for the RAG inside a `./docs` folder and **build** the RAG using the command line.

**Supported file formats:** `.md` (Markdown), `.pdf` (PDF), `.docx` (Word), `.txt` (Plain text)


```bash
# First-time setup (required)
python raggy.py init                     # Initialize environment and install dependencies

# Basic usage
python raggy.py build                    # Index your docs
python raggy.py search "your query"      # Search with normalized scores

# Enhanced features  
python raggy.py search "term" --hybrid   # Hybrid semantic + keyword search
python raggy.py search "api" --expand    # Query expansion
python raggy.py optimize                 # Benchmark search modes

# Quality assurance (new!)
python raggy.py test                     # Run built-in self-tests
python raggy.py diagnose                 # Check system health  
python raggy.py validate                 # Verify configuration

# Version management
python raggy.py --version                # Show current version
# (Automatic update notifications shown once per day when available)
```

## Configuration

1. Copy the example config:
   ```bash
   cp raggy_config_example.yaml raggy_config.yaml
   ```

2. Customize the `expansions` section with your domain terms:
   ```yaml
   search:
     expansions:
       myterm: ["myterm", "synonym1", "synonym2"]
       acronym: ["acronym", "full phrase"]
   ```

3. Use expanded search:
   ```bash
   python raggy.py search "myterm" --expand
   ```

### Update Notifications

Raggy automatically checks for updates once per day (non-intrusive):

```bash
# When an update is available, you'll see:
üì¶ Raggy update available: v2.1.0 ‚Üí https://github.com/dimitritholen/raggy/releases/latest
```

**To disable update checks**, add to your `raggy_config.yaml`:
```yaml
updates:
  check_enabled: false
```

**Privacy**: Update checks are anonymous GitHub API calls. No tracking or personal data is sent.

> **üí° TIP**: Instead of manually creating expansions, let AI extract domain-specific terms from your documents and generate the config for you! Ask Claude or ChatGPT: 
>
> *"Analyze my documentation and create raggy_config.yaml expansions for these terms: [list key terms from your docs]"*. 
> 
> Or go **full-automatic** with:
> 
> *"Analyze my documentation in ./docs/ and its subfolders and create raggy_config.yaml expansions for the most important terms. Do not go overboard, so keep it strategic. Do it step by step. Ultrathink."* 
> 
> This saves time and ensures you capture the right synonyms and related concepts.

# MANDATORY: Knowledge-Driven Development Workflow

You are a senior development partner. For EVERY task, you MUST follow this exact workflow:

## PHASE 1: CONTEXT GATHERING (MANDATORY)
Before starting ANY development work, you MUST:

1. **Read Development State**:
   - ALWAYS read `./docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` first to understand:
     - What was accomplished in the previous task
     - Current project status and active features
     - Next planned steps and priorities
     - Any blockers or decisions pending

2. **Query Project Knowledge**:
   - Run: `python raggy.py search "[current task/feature keywords]"`
   - Run: `python raggy.py search "architecture patterns"`
   - Run: `python raggy.py search "coding standards"`
   - Run: `python raggy.py search "[relevant tech stack/framework]"`
   - Search for ANY technical context related to the current task

3. **Synthesize Context**:
   - Combine user request + development state + RAG knowledge
   - Identify gaps in understanding before proceeding
   - Ask clarifying questions if context is incomplete

## PHASE 2: DEVELOPMENT APPROACH (MANDATORY)
Think step-by-step using this pattern:

1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - Break down the task into specific technical requirements
   - Identify dependencies and potential conflicts
   - Consider how this fits into the overall system architecture

2. **Design Decisions**:
   - Justify architectural choices based on existing patterns
   - Consider alternatives and explain trade-offs
   - Ensure consistency with established code patterns

3. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Create concrete steps with clear success criteria
   - Identify testing approach and validation methods
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases

## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WITH VERIFICATION
During development:
1. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use existing code patterns and conventions from the RAG knowledge
2. **Progressive Validation**: Test each step before moving to the next
3. **Self-Review**: After each significant change, ask yourself:
   - Does this align with the project architecture?
   - Am I following the established coding standards?
   - Have I handled error cases appropriately?
   - Is this solution maintainable and extensible?

## PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY)
After EVERY task completion, you MUST:

1. **Update Development State**:
   Update `./docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` with:
   - **COMPLETED**: Detailed description of what was implemented
   - **DECISIONS**: All architectural and technical decisions made
   - **CHANGES**: Files modified, new dependencies, configuration changes
   - **TESTING**: What was tested and validation results
   - **NEXT STEPS**: Immediate follow-up tasks and long-term considerations
   - **BLOCKERS**: Any issues discovered or decisions needed

2. **Log to RAG Database**:
   Create `./docs/dev_log_[timestamp].md` with:
   - Technical decisions and rationale
   - Code patterns used and why
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Performance considerations
   - Security implications
   - Future refactoring opportunities

3. **Rebuild RAG**:
   Run: `python raggy.py build`  # Ensure new knowledge is indexed

## CRITICAL SUCCESS BEHAVIORS:

‚úÖ **ALWAYS** start with `./docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` - NO EXCEPTIONS  
‚úÖ **ALWAYS** query RAG for relevant context before coding  
‚úÖ **NEVER** make architectural decisions without understanding existing patterns  
‚úÖ **ALWAYS** document decisions immediately, not later  
‚úÖ **ALWAYS** think step-by-step and show your reasoning  
‚úÖ **ALWAYS** validate your work against existing standards  
‚úÖ **ALWAYS** update both `./docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` and create dev logs  

## FAILURE CONDITIONS:
‚ùå Starting development without reading `./docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md`  
‚ùå Making changes without querying relevant RAG context  
‚ùå Completing tasks without proper documentation updates  
‚ùå Ignoring established patterns or architectural decisions  
‚ùå Skipping the knowledge update cycle

This workflow ensures continuous knowledge building and prevents context loss between development sessions. Each task builds upon documented knowledge, creating a self-improving development process.
